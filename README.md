# Fashion_Mnist-Classifiers

## University Project
A project from Computer Science and Engineering department of the University of Ioannina (UOI).

## Description
This project implements three classifiers about clothes.

The dataset for clothes is provided by keras framework.

Sklearn framework is used for the implementation of each method-classifier.

f1score, accuracy, probabilities and execution time are the metrics that are used for the evaluation of each method.

## Uploaded Files
Three classifiers for fashion mnist dataset by keras:
1) ***Method1.py***: Use Nearest Neighbor k-NN with Euclidean distance or Cosine distance.
2) ***Method2.py***: Use Neural Networks with 1 hidden layer and 500 neurons or 2 hidden layers with 500 neurons at the first layer and 200 at the second layer.
3) ***Method3.py***: Use Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernel functions (linear, gaussian, cosine).
